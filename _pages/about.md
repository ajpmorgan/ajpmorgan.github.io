I am an education economist working as a Project Manager in the Ness School of Management and Economics at South Dakota State University where I engage in teaching, research, and serve as the point-person for accreditation.

I'm an applied microeconomist by training, and my primary research interests lie in labor economics and the economics of education. My broader interests are in education policy generally, and I've published work in education using quantitative methods. You can find more about my work on the Research page of this website. 

I previously spent time in the public sector as a Senior Data Analyst at the Chicago Public Schools and a postdoctoral Research Fellow at University College London after completing my PhD in economics at the University of Illinois Chicago. 

I have several years of experience in data analysis, statistics, and quantitative methods, with particular expertise in causal inference methods. I am well-versed in Python, SQL, SAS, Stata, and MS and Google office suites and have a working knowledge of R, Unix environment and version control using git.
