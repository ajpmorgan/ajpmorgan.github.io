I am a Senior Data Analyst in the Office of Access and Enrollment, Chicago Public Schools.

I was previously employed as a postdoctoral Research Fellow within the Social Research Institute at University College London after completing my PhD in economics at the University of Illinois Chicago. 

I have several years of experience in data analysis, statistics, and quantitative methods, with particular expertise in causal inference methods. I am well-versed in Python, SQL, SAS, Stata, and MS and Google office suites and have a working knowledge of R, Unix environment and version control using git. 

My primary research interests lie in labor economics and the economics of education as well as quantitative work in education. You can find my public works on the Research page of this website.
